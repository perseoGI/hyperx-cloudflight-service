# Hyperx Cloudflight Services

This is a WIP project made in collaboration with [@devcexx](https://github.com/devcexx)

As a result of "reverse engineering" the comunication between the HyperX
Cloudflight Headset with this program you will be able to obtain some
information about the headset in Linux:

- Battery percentage level
- Microphone status (muted / un-muted)

This program locates the headset HUD on a linux distribution and intercepts some packets

## TODO

- Current volume of headset
- Current power status (on/off)
